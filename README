==================================================
Send2Trash -- Send files to trash on all platforms
==================================================

This is a Python 2 package. The Python 3 package is at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Send2Trash3k .

Send2Trash is a small package that sends files to the Trash (or Recycle Bin) *natively* and on
*all platforms*. On OS X, it uses native ``FSMoveObjectToTrashSync`` Cocoa calls, on Windows, it uses native (and ugly) ``SHFileOperation`` win32 calls. On other platforms, it moves the file to the first folder it finds that looks like a trash (so far, it's known to work on Ubuntu).

Installation
------------

Download the source from http://hg.hardcoded.net/send2trash and install it with::

>>> sudo python setup.py install

On Windows, you'll need Visual Studio 2008 to compile it. Note that the install you'll get will not be a "universal" package. If you install it on OS X, only the "osx" module will be compiled, and if you install it on Windows, only the "win" module will be compiled.

To have a cross-platform package you can ship around, you'll have compile the package on both platforms and merge the results so that both compiled modules are in the same package.

Usage
-----

>>> from send2trash import send2trash
>>> send2trash('some_file')

When there's a problem ``OSError`` is raised.
